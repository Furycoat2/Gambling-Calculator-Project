-- Use instructions --
1. Extract the master folder from the zip and put it somewhere.
2. Use it like an EXE file, it should open a page in your browser.
3. Double check and make sure both calc.js and gamblingproblem.html are in the same folder.
4. You should be met with the main page, if so, your done! just use the calculator!

-- Extra instructions --
If your slow and need more guidance or if your just confused, here's some more.

1. The first text bar is the amount you want to reach in a single bet click the box, press backspace, and type in the amount
you wish to get to with one bet.
2. The second text bar is your current currency type !booty in the chat to see how much you have, that's the number you put in that box.
3. Press the button. The value you need will appear as the number below the button. The button is labled "Go Go Gambling Problem!".
4. If the value is above 100, your goal for one bet is too high.

-- Tips -- 

Bet only 100-200 more than what you have when you start and use that as a marker.

If it starts to cost more than 70 to bet, your running out of chances, and if your trying to keep your losses or gain, it may be wise to lower your goal a little.

-- Extra details -- 

The calculator uses a mix of HTML/Javascript.

The formula is (target-current)/4=bet
